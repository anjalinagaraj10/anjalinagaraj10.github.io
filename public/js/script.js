Despite me constantly making fun of you, I hope you know that I think you are one of the smartest, strongest and most independent people that I’ve met. Though we’re opposites in many ways I definitely have a lot to learn from you when it comes to not taking oneself too seriously, being kinder to people around me and just handling life in general. Thanks for all the laughs (both at and with you :) ), school memories, Frankie talks and also for willing to get your feet wet at the beach everytime :)); you’re a beautiful person - inside and out. </p></li><li> <h5 id='cv-h5'><b>Akshadh</b></h5> <p id='cv-p'> Happy burtthdaiiii saaam!!

And thank god for that. The nicknames, the superstitions, dil dosti dance, our impromptu sleepovers, your old school notebook covered in pink wrapping paper and my blue sparkly diary. So many inside jokes that I'm pretty sure even we wouldn't remember. Also. Ferrero rocher (nope I'm never forgetting that, and I hope to god you haven't, otherwise this is just awkward). I've never gossiped more with anyone. Ever. Somehow, we got so close so quickly, and 14 year old me wouldn't have been able to anything without you. Have a non sucky day, sampriti. Love you. </p></li></ul> <hr> </h4> <hr> </div></div></div><div class='col'></div>"
