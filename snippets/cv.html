            Happy Birthday Sam!
            You’re a super fun and entertaining person and spending time with you is always nice. Looking forward to many more movie nights, party planning adventures, riding on the scooter and hopefully one day getting our nails done together. 🤍
            
            We’ll try throwing you another surprise party where we’ll get someone better than Sachin to dress up as a clown and actually scares you 🤡 . Have a super fun day quarantining at home and eating lots and lots of yummy food 
            Love you
            Tanishaaaaaaa

            Happy birthday Sam. You're already 19!
            I hope this virus thingy gets better quicker,
            So that we can have some liquor,

            The 2001 baby finally turns 19! Happy happy happy birthday Sampritiii! Its been almost 4 years since that really awkward first meeting in school and I’m still very thankful to Sishya for introducing you into my life. Despite me constantly making fun of you, I hope you know that I think you are one of the smartest, strongest and most independent people that I’ve met. Though we’re opposites in many ways I definitely have a lot to learn from you when it comes to not taking oneself too seriously, being kinder to people around me and just handling life in general. Thanks for all the laughs (both at and with you :) ), school memories, Frankie talks and also for willing to get your feet wet at the beach everytime :)); you’re a beautiful person - inside and out.
