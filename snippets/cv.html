            I know you are scared to read what I will be writing about, but don‚Äôt worry what 
            comes ahead is not that bad. You are one of the most sweet, caring and hilarious 
            people I know, and the smartest girl in the while world. When someone tells that 
            to you don‚Äôt believe them cuz they are bullshitting you right on your face. This 
            is the truth and you need to accept it. But seriously, you a very nice, sweet and 
            crazy. I personally think you are very talented because you put up with my bullshit 
            like every day. You do annoy the shit out of me sometimes but that‚Äôs fine I know I 
            did the same to you. You need to know that when I mean I will leak your passwords I 
            don‚Äôt mean it. FYI: I am more south Indian than you are and far cooler than you. Also, 
            u should stop third wheeling in my dates, LOL!!!!! HAPPY 19TH BIRTHDAY FIONA AND I 
            HOPE YOUR SHREK APRROACHES YOU SOON üòâ

            Hey Anjali, HAPPY BIRTHDAY!!! I hope your last day as an 18 year old was as lit as you wanted
            it to be. It‚Äôs crazy how you never get high no matter what you take because you are naturally
            on that level always smiling and giggling. Have a great one :)

            So I devoted much of my time today retrospecting on the Shrek series. Specifically, I ruminated over a
            matter of contention between us on who the true protagonist of this classic trilogy is; Donkey or Shrek.
            On the one hand, as you pointed out, all three movies do focus on consecutive stages of Shrek‚Äôs life,
            with the plot of each movie essentially being a hero‚Äôs journey in which Shrek overcomes a challenge and
            in the process experiences personal growth. Again, as you pointed out the series is also named after
            him. On the other hand, I argued for Donkey being the protagonist because I felt like disagreeing with
            you in the moment and I‚Äôm stubborn. After much deliberation, and careful reflection on the movies
            themselves and the facts you presented, I concede to you that Shrek is the protagonist of the Shrek
            movies.
          </p>

            Now that this matter of importance is out of the way,
            I also wanted to wish you a Happy Birthday.
            Being a whole two years older than you, I consider it my obligation to share with you the vast reservoirs
            of wisdom my seniority has endowed me. However, my reservoirs are too vast for the space Mihir has
            allotted me on this page, so I guess I will have to enlighten you another time. Besides, I get the feeling
            you have what it takes to handle life as a nineteen year old just fine without my wisdom. You are one of
            the funniest people I know and have the magical ability of brightening up a room like nobody I‚Äôve met
            before, Even though you sometimes act dumb, you are actually really smart, and most importantly, even
            though you repeatedly deny it, you are an amazing dancer!
            It has been great being your friend and spending time with you over the past year. I really, really hope
            we can plan a hike soon.
            Here‚Äôs to you turning nineteen!
            May this be the year you finally do a proper unassisted push-up.

            Happy Birthday Anjali!!! You were my first friend in davis!!( honestly i never thought we would 
            vibe, but we bonded over our stupidity i guess??) There are a few things that i appreciate about 
            you as a friend and i wouldn't tell them to you if it weren't your bday, so there you go, Whenever 
            i've come to you with a problem, i didn't get a solution,but your humor (which i do get btw) 
            definitely lightened my mood and that is exactly what i needed at that time, so thank you. Your 
            storytelling skills are on point, and i'm not even kidding but your hiking stories have actually 
            inspired me to achieve more in lifeüòÇ. I believe you can give a ted talk someday, and that's why stay 
            my friend cause i need free tickets to the event. Thank you for being here and listening to my Ted 
            talk and i wish you a very happy birthday.
